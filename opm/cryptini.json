      "Description" : "This is a TiniFile implementation that is resistant to tampering.\r\nIn normal (PlainTextMode = FALSE) mode, any calls to Write values are\r\naccompanied by an embedded MD5 hash value (and also reversed then Base64\/IDEA Encrypted)\r\nThis is invisible in normal use (i.e. read methods return normal results)\r\nbut there are added methods to internally verify any entries.\r\nIt also is able to write a standard ident section containing various\r\ndetails including authorship and copyright.  A single function allows\r\nyou to check on app startup whether this section has been altered.\r\nIt also includes a useful 'First Run' functionality.\r\nIt's intended purpose is to store information that cannot be easily altered\r\nin a text editor (such as HiScores etc) by a weekend scripter.\r\nThe WriteInteger method is the most secure as it double-encrypts as well as\r\nembedding an MD5Hash value as a checksum.  Very handy to save scores etc.\r\nIt is paired with ReadInteger and VerifyInteger.",
